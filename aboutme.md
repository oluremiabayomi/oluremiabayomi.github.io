Currently, Dr. Remi is an Assistant Professor at Northwood University where I teach Mathematics, Statistics, Data Mining, and Predictive Analytics classes, based on extensive experience in leveraging quantitative methods for providing veritable insight into underlying data patterns. Oluremi completed his Doctoral degree in Statistics and Analytics after his Master of Arts degree in Mathematics, both at Central Michigan University. He also obtained a Bachelor of Science from the University of Lagos, Nigeria after initially completing a National Diploma(Associates) degree at The Federal Polytechnic, Ede both in different south-western parts of Nigeria.

Dr. Remi has actively taught at all levels of education since August 1998. He spent his first seven years as a teacher in an elementary school as a paraprofessional educator. Then he went back to school for his Associates and Bachelors' degrees. During this time, he was a business owner in Lagos, Nigeria where he ran his home tutoring services that catered to students of all age groups in salvaging the struggling mathematics experiences of many students. After his Bachelor's degree, he completed the National Youth Service Corps program required of all Nigerians graduating from a tertiary institution under 30 years of age. During this time, he secured a graduate assistantship to complete his Master of Arts and Doctoral degree at Central Michigan University.
Entrepreneurial and commercially astute, Dr. Remi is a self-motivated, well-grounded change agent with strong work ethics, original thought, and a life-long passion for continuous learning and meeting set targets through unrelenting analysis, analytics, and collaboration.

Oluremi spends his leisure time watching soccer matches, reading self-help books, and brainstorming ideas with his wife on best practices on how to help students succeed and learn the applications of concepts learned in class. He enjoys doing this with his wife(who is also a college instructor).
